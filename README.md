# Eye-Blink-Detection-Project

This project aims to develop a real-time eye blink detection system using computer vision and python. The system can be used in various applications such as fatigue detection, driver attention monitoring, and human-computer interaction.

Features:
Real-time eye blink detection using webcam.
Accurate detection of face and eye blinks using pre trained models (Haar Cascades).
User-friendly interface for easy usage.
